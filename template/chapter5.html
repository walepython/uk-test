                    Chapter 5 goes through the development of the democratic system in the UK and the constitutional institutions that comprise it. It provides information on the King’s roles as head of the state, the members and functions of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the roles of The Speaker, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, as well as how the electoral system works and how elected members can be contacted. It also presents the powers of the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

                    Moreover, a review of what criminal law and civil law are is given together with examples of them. Chapter 5 then explains the role of the police force and their duties and the different court systems that exist in the UK as well as their functions. Attention is also given to the fundamental principles of the European Convention of Human Rights and how laws for human rights are applied in the UK. This is followed by an overview of the taxation system in the UK to include income tax and national insurance and finally covers what is required to the drive a car in the UK.

                <h5>The development of British democracy</h5>
                <p class="chapter6">
                    Democracy is a system of government where the whole adult population gets a say. This might be by direct voting or by choosing representatives to make decisions on their behalf.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter7">
                    At the turn of the 19th century, Britain was not a democracy as we know it today. Although there were elections to select members of Parliament (MPs), only a small group of people could vote. They were men who were over 21 years of age and who owned a certain amount of property.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter8">
                    The franchise (that is, the number of people who had the right to vote) grew over the course of the 19th century and political parties began to involve ordinary men and women as members.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter9">
                    In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the Chartists campaigned for reform. They wanted six changes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>for every man to have the vote</li>
                    <li> elections every year</li>
                    <li>for all regions to be equal in the electoral system</li>
                    <li>secret ballots</li>
                    <li> for any man to be able to stand as an MP</li>
                    <li>for MPs to be paid</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="chapter10">
                    At the time, the campaign was generally seen as failure. However, by 1918 most of these reforms had been adopted. The voting franchise was also extended to women over 30, and then in 1928 to men and women over 21. In 1969, the voting age was reduced to 18 for men and women.
                </p>
                <h5>The British constitution</h5>
                <p class="chapter11">
                    A constitution is a set of principles by which a country is governed. It includes all of the institutions that are responsible for running the country and how their power is kept in check. The constitution also includes laws and conventions. The British constitution is not written down in any single document, and therefore it is described as ‘unwritten’. This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France, has never had a revolution which led permanently to a totally new system of government. Our most important institutions have developed over hundreds of years. Some people believe that there should be a single document, but others believe an unwritten constitution allows for more flexibility and better government.

                 <p class="constitutional">
                    In the UK, there are several different parts of government. The main ones are:

                    <li>local government.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p class="constitutional">
                    In addition, there are devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that have the power to legislate on certain issues.
                 </p>
            </div>
            <div id="monarch">
                <h2>The monarchy</h2>
                <p class="monarch">
                    King Charles III is the head of state of the UK. He is also the monarch or head of state for many countries in the Commonwealth. The UK has a constitutional monarchy. This means that the king or queen does not rule the country but appoints the government, which the people have chosen in a democratic election. The monarch invites the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs, or the leader of a coalition between more than one party, to become the Prime Minister. The monarch has regular meetings with the Prime Minister and can advise, warn and encourage, but the decisions on government policies are made by the Prime Minister and cabinet.
                </p>
                <p class="monarch2">
                    The King has reigned since his mother’s death in September 2022. He is married to Queen Camilla. His eldest son, Prince William (the Prince of Wales), is the heir to the throne.
                </p>
                <p class="monarch3">
                    The King has important ceremonial roles, such as the opening of the new parliamentary session each year. On this occasion the King makes a speech which summarises the government’s policies for the year ahead. All Acts of Parliament are made in his name.
                </p>
                <p class="monarch4">
                    The King has an important role in providing stability and continuity. While governments and Prime Ministers change regularly, the King continues as head of state. He provides a focus for national identity and pride.

                <p class="system">
                    The system of government in the UK is a parliamentary democracy. The UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies. Voters in each constituency elect their Member of Parliament (MP) in a General Election. All of the elected MPs form the House of Commons. Most MPs belong to a political party, and the party with the majority of MPs forms the government. If one party does not get a majority, two parties can join together to form a coalition.

                <p class="house">
                    The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two chambers in Parliament because its members are democratically elected. The Prime Minister and almost all the members of the cabinet are members of the House of Commons (MPs). Each MP represents a parliamentary constituency, which is a small area of the country. MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:
                </p>

                <h2>The House of Lords</h2>
                <p class="house-lord">
                    Members of the House of Lords, known as peers, are not elected by the people and do not represent a constituency. The role and membership of the House of Lords has changed over the last 50 years.
                </p>
                <p  class="house-lord2">Until 1958, all peers were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>‘hereditary’, which means they inherited their title, or</li>
                    <li>senior judges, or</li>
                    <li>bishops of the Church of England.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="house-lord3">
                    Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime. These are called life peers. They have usually had an important career in politics, business, law or another profession. Life peers are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister. They also include people nominated by the leaders of the other main political parties or by an independent Appointments Commission for non-party peers.
                </p>
                <p class="house-lord4">
                    Since 1999, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the House of Lords. They now elect a few of their number to represent them in the House of Lords.
                </p>
                <p class="house-lord5">
                    The House of Lords is normally more independent of the government than the House of Commons. It can suggest amendments or propose new laws, which are then discussed by MPs. The House of Lords checks laws that have been passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit for purpose. It also holds the government to account to make sure that it is working in the best interests of the people. There are peers who are specialists in particular areas, and their knowledge is useful in making and checking laws. The House of Commons has powers to overrule the House of Lords, but these are not used often.

                    Debates in the House of Commons are chaired by the Speaker. This person is the chief officer of the House of Commons. The Speaker is neutral and does not represent a political party, even though he or she is an MP, represents a constituency and deals with the constituents’ problems like any other MP. The Speaker is chosen by other MPs in a secret ballot.

The leader of the opposition also appoints senior opposition MPs to be ‘shadow ministers’. They form the shadow cabinet and their role is to challenge the government and put forward alternative policies.

                <h2>The party system</h2>
                <p class="party">
                    Anyone aged 18 or over can stand for election as an MP but they are unlikely to win unless they have been nominated to represent one of the major political parties. These are the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, or one of the parties representing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish interests.
                </p>
                <p class="party2">
                    There are a few MPs who do not represent any of the main political parties. They are called ‘independents’ and usually represent an issue important to their constituency.
                </p>
                <p class="party3">
                    The main political parties actively look for members of the public to join their debates, contribute to their costs, and help at elections for Parliament or for local government. They have branches in most constituencies and hold policy-making conferences every year.
                </p>
                <p class="party4">
                    Pressure and lobby groups are organisations which try to influence government policy. They play an important role in politics. Some are representative organisations such as the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), which represents the views of British business. Others campaign on particular topics, such as the environment (for example, Greenpeace) or human rights (for example, Liberty).

                <p class="civil">
                    Civil servants support the government in developing and implementing its policies. They also deliver public services. Civil servants are accountable to ministers. They are chosen on merit and are politically neutral – they are not political appointees. People can apply to join the civil service through an application process, like other jobs in the UK. Civil servants are expected to carry out their role with dedication and a commitment to the civil service and its core values. These are: integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality (including being politically neutral).

                <p class="local">
                    Towns, cities and rural areas in the UK are governed by democratically elected councils, often called ‘local authorities’. Some areas have both district and county councils, which have different functions. Most large towns and cities have a single local authority.
                </p>
                <p class="local2">
                    Local authorities provide a range of services in their areas. They are funded by money from central government and by local taxes.
                </p>
                <p class="local3">
                    Many local authorities appoint a mayor, who is the ceremonial leader of the council. In some towns, a mayor is elected to be the effective leader of the administration. London has 33 local authorities, with the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London coordinating policies across the capital. For most local authorities, local elections for councillors are held in May every year. Many candidates stand for council election as members of a political party.

                    Since 1997, some powers have been devolved from the central government to give people in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland more control over matters that directly affect them. There has been a Welsh Assembly (now called the Senedd) and a Scottish Parliament since 1999. There is also a Northern Ireland Assembly, although this has been suspended on a few occasions.

There is a power-sharing agreement which distributes ministerial offices amongst the main parties. The Assembly has 90 elected members, known as MLAs (members of the Legislative Assembly).

                <p class="electoral2">
                    If you are eligible to vote, you can register by contacting your local council electoral registration office. This is usually based at your local council (in Scotland it may be based elsewhere). If you don’t know which local authority you come under, you can find out by visiting www.aboutmyvote.co.uk and entering you postcode. You can also download voter registration forms in English, Welsh and some other languages.

                <p class="electoral3">
                    The electoral register is updated every year in September or October. An electoral registration form is sent to every household and this has to be completed and returned with the names of everyone who is resident in the household and eligible to vote.

                <p class="electoral4">
                    In Northern Ireland a different system operates. This is called ‘individual registration’ and all those entitled to vote must complete their own registration form. Once registered, people stay on the register provided their personal details do not change. For more information see the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website at www.eoni.org.uk

This tells you where your polling station or polling place is and when the election will take place. On election day, the polling station or place will be open from 7.00 am until 10.00 pm.

You can check that you have the right photo ID at gov.uk/how-to-vote/photo-id-youll-need. You will then get your ballot paper, which you take to a polling booth to fill in privately. You should make up your own mind who to vote for. No one has the right to make you vote for a particular candidate. You should follow the instructions on the ballot paper. Once you have completed it, put it in the ballot box.

                <p class="check-that">
                    One of the most important responsibilities of all residents in the UK is to know and obey the law. This section will tell you about the legal system in the UK and some of the laws that may affect you. Britain is proud of being a welcoming country, but all residents, regardless of their background, are expected to comply with the law and to understand that some things which may be allowed in other legal systems are not acceptable in the UK. Those who do not respect the law should not expect to be allowed to become permanent residents of the UK.

                <p class="check-that2">
                    The law is relevant to all areas of life in the UK. You should make sure that you are aware of the laws which affect your everyday life, including both your personal and business affairs.

                <h2>The law in the UK</h2>
                <p class="the-law">
                    Every person in the UK receives equal treatment under the law. This means that the law applies in the same way to everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from.
                </p>
                <p class="the-law2">
                    Laws can be divided into criminal law and civil law:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Criminal law relates to crimes, which are usually investigated by the police or another authority such as a council, and which are punished by the courts.</li>
                    <li>Civil law is used to settle disputes between individuals or groups.</li>
                    <p class="the-law3">Examples of criminal laws are:</p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Carrying a weapon: it is a criminal offence to carry a weapon of any kind, even if it is for self-defence. This includes a gun, a knife or anything that is made or adapted to cause injury.</li>
                    <li>Drugs: selling or buying drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis is illegal in the UK.</li>
                    <li>Racial crime: it is a criminal offence to cause harassment, alarm or distress to someone because of their religion or ethnic origin.</li>
                    <li>Selling tobacco: it is illegal to sell tobacco products (for example, cigarettes, cigars, roll-up tobacco) to anyone under the age of 18.</li>
                    <li>Smoking in public places: it is against the law to smoke tobacco products in nearly every enclosed public place in the UK. There are signs displayed to tell you where you cannot smoke.</li>
                    <li>Buying alcohol: it is a criminal offence to sell alcohol to anyone who is under 18 or to buy alcohol for people who are under the age of 18. (There is one exception: people aged 16 or over can drink alcohol with a meal in a hotel or restaurant).</li>
                    <li>Drinking in public: some places have alcohol-free zones where you cannot drink in public. The police can also confiscate alcohol or move young people on from public places. You can be fined or arrested.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="the-law4">
                    This list does not include all crimes. There are many that apply in most countries, such as murder, theft and assault. You can find out more about types of crime in the UK at www.gov.uk
                </p>
                <p class="the-law5">
                    Example of civil laws are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Housing law: this includes disputes between landlords and tenants over issues such as repairs and eviction.</li>
                    <li>Consumer rights: an example of this is a dispute about faulty goods or services.</li>
                    <li>Employment law: these cases include disputes over wages and cases of unfair dismissal or discrimination in the workplace.</li>
                    <li>Debt: people might be taken to court if they owe money to someone.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="police">
                <h2>The police and their duties</h2>
                <p class="police">
                    The job of the police in the UK is to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protect life and property</li>
                    <li>Prevent disturbances (also known as keeping the peace)</li>
                    <li>Prevent and detect crime.</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="police2">
                    The police are organised into a number of separate police forces headed by Chief Constables. They are independent of the government.
                </p>
                <p class="police3">
                    In November 2012, the public elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in England and Wales. These are directly elected individuals who are responsible for the delivery of an efficient and effective police force that reflects the needs of their local communities. PCCs set local police priorities and the local policing budget. They also appoint the local Chief Constable.
                </p>
                <p class="police4">
                    The police force is a public service that helps and protects everyone, no matter what their background or where they live. Police officers must themselves obey the law. They must not misuse their authority, make a false statement, be rude or abusive, or commit racial discrimination. If police officers corrupt or misuse their authority they are severely punished.
                </p>
                <p class="police5">
                    Police officers are supported by the police community support officers (PCSOs). PCSOs have different roles according to the area but usually patrol the streets, work with the public, and support police officers at crime scenes and major events.
                </p>
                <p class="police6">
                    All people in the UK are expected to help the police prevent and detect crimes whenever they can. If you are arrested and taken to a police station, a police officer will tell you the reason for your arrest and you will be able to seek legal advice.
                </p>
                <p class="police7">
                    If something goes wrong, the police complaints system tries to put it right. Anyone can make a complaint about the police by going to a police station and writing to the Chief Constable of the police force involved. Complaints can also be made to an independent body in England and Wales (www.policeconduct.gov.uk). In Scotland, if you are unhappy with the way your complaint has been handled, you can contact the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner at http://pirc.scot/. In Northern Ireland, you should contact the Police Ombudsman’s Office (www.policeombudsman.org).

                <h2>Terrorism and extremism</h2>
                <p class="terrorism">
                    The UK faces a range of terrorist threats. The most serious of these is from Al Qa’ida, its affiliates and like-minded organisations. The UK also faces threats from other kinds of terrorism, such as Northern Ireland-related terrorism.
                </p>
                <p class="terrorism2">
                    All terrorist groups try to radicalise and recruit people to their cause. How, where and to what extent they try to do so will vary. Evidence shows that these groups attract very low levels of public support, but people who want to make their home in the UK should be aware of this threat. It is important that all citizens feel safe. This includes feeling safe from all kinds of extremism (vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values), including religious extremism and far-right extremism.
                </p>
                <p class="terrorism3">
                    If you think someone is trying to persuade you to join an extremist or terrorist cause, you should notify your local police force.

                <h2>The judiciary</h2>
                <p class="judiciary">
                    Judges (who are together called ‘the judiciary’) are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that trials are conducted fairly. The government cannot interfere with this.
                </p>
                <p class="judiciary2">
                    Sometimes the actions of the government are claimed to be illegal. If the judges agree, then the government must either change its policies or ask Parliament to change the law. If judges find that a public body is not respecting someone’s legal rights, they can order that body to change its practices and/or pay compensation.
                </p>
                <p class="judiciary3">
                    Judges also make decisions in disputes between members of the public or organisations. These might be about contracts, property or employment rights or after an accident.

                <p class="Magistrate">
                    In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, most minor criminal cases are dealt with in a Magistrates’ Court. In Scotland, minor criminal offences go to a Justice of the Peace Court.
                </p>
                <p class="Magistrate2">
                    Magistrates and Justices of the Peace (JPs) are members of the local community. In England, Wales and Scotland they usually work unpaid and do not need legal qualifications. They receive training to do the job and are supported by a legal adviser. Magistrates decide the verdict in each case that comes before them and, if the person is found guilty, the sentence that they are given. In Northern Ireland, cases are heard by a District Judge or Deputy District Judge, who is legally qualified and paid.

                </h2>
                <p class="crown">
                    In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, serious offences are tried in front of a judge and a jury in a Crown Court. In Scotland, serious cases are heard in a Sheriff Court with either a sheriff or a sheriff with a jury. The most serious cases in Scotland, such as murder, are heard at a High Court with a judge and jury. A jury is made up of members of the public chosen at random from the local electoral register. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a jury has 12 members, and in Scotland a jury has 15 members. Everyone who is summoned to do jury service must do it unless they are not eligible (for example, because they have a criminal conviction) or they provide a good reason to be excused, such as ill health.
                </p>
                <p class="crown">
                    The jury has to listen to the evidence presented at the trial and then decide a verdict of ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’ based on what they have heard. In Scotland, a third verdict of ‘not proven’ is also possible. If the jury finds a defendant guilty, the judge decides the penalty.

                    In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if an accused person is aged 10 to 17, the case is normally heard in a Youth Court in front of up to three specially trained magistrates or a District Judge. The most serious cases will go the Crown Court. The parents or carers of the young person are expected to attend the hearing. Members of the public are not allowed in Youth Courts, and the name or photographs of the accused young person cannot be published in newspapers or used by the media.

                <p class="youth2">

These include people trying to get back money that is owed to them, cases involving personal injury, family matters, breaches of contract, and divorce. In Scotland, most of these matters are dealt with in the Sheriff Court. More serious civil cases – for example, when a large amount of compensation is being claimed – are dealt with in the High Court of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, they are dealt with in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.

It is important to find out which aspects of law a solicitor specialises in and to check that they have the right experience to help you with your case. Many advertise in local newspapers. Citizens Advice (www.citizensadvice.org.uk) can give you names of local solicitors and which areas of law they specialise in. You can also get this information from the Law Society (www.lawsociety.org.uk) in England and Wales, the Law Society of Scotland (www.lawscot.org.uk) or the Law Society of Northern Ireland (www.lawsoc-ni.org). Solicitors’ charges are usually based on how much time they spend of a case. It is very important to find out at the start how much a case is likely to cost.

                    Britain has a long history of respecting an individual’s rights and ensuring essential freedoms. These rights have their roots in Magna Carta, the Habeas Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights of 1689, and they have developed over a period of time. British diplomats and lawyers had an important role in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The UK was one of the first countries to sign the Convention in 1950.

                <p class="domestic">
                    In the UK, brutality and violence in the home is a serious crime. Anyone who is violent towards their partner – whether they are a man or a woman, married or living together – can be prosecuted. Any man who forces a woman to have sex, including a woman’s husband, can be charged with rape.

                <p class="domestic2">
                    It is important for anyone facing domestic violence to get help as soon as possible. A solicitor or the Citizens Advice Bureau can explain the available options. In some areas there are safe places to go and stay in, called refuges or shelters. The 24-hour National Domestic Violence Freephone Helpline is available on 0808 2000 247 at any time, and its voicemail service allows callers to leave a message to be called back. You can find out more by visiting its website on https://www.nationalhelpline.org.uk. Alternatively, you can try the Women’s Aid website on https://www.womensaid.org.uk. In an emergency, you should always call the police, who can also help you to find a safe place to stay.

                <p class="income-tax">
                    People in the UK have to pay tax on their income, which includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> wages from paid employment</li>

                    <li>income from property, savings and dividends.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="income-tax2">
                    Money raised from income tax pays for government services such as roads, education, police and the armed forces.
                </p>
                <p class="income-tax3">
                    For most people, the right amount of income tax is automatically taken from their income from employment by their employer and paid directly to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the government department that collects taxes. This system is called “Pay As You Earn” (PAYE). If you are self-employed, you need to pay your own tax through a system called ‘self-assessment’, which includes completing a tax return. Other people may also need to complete a tax return. If HMRC sends you a tax return, it is important to completed and return the form as soon as you have all the necessary information.
                </p>
                <p class="income-tax4">
                    You can find out more about income tax at www.gov.uk/income-tax. You can get help and advice about taxes and completing tax forms from the HMRC self-assessment helpline on 0300 200 3310, and by visiting https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs.

                <p class="national">
                    Almost everybody in the UK who is in paid work, including self-employed people, must pay National Insurance Contributions. The money raised from National Insurance Contributions is used to pay for state benefits and services such as the state retirement pension and the National Health Service (NHS).
                </p>
                <p class="national2">
                    Employees have their National Insurance Contributions deducted from their pay by their employer. People who are self-employed need to pay National Insurance Contributions themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="national3">
                    Anyone who does not pay enough National Insurance Contributions will not be able to receive certain contributory benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance or a full state retirement pension. Some workers, such as part-time workers, may not qualify for statutory payments such as maternity pay if they do not earn enough.
                </p>
                <p class="national4">

                <p class="getting">
                    A National Insurance number is a unique personal account number. It makes sure that the National Insurance Contributions and tax you pay are properly recorded against your name. All young people in the UK are sent a National Insurance number just before their 16th birthday.
                </p>
                <p class="getting2">
                    A non-UK national living in the UK and looking for work, starting work or setting up as self-employed will need a National Insurance number. However, you can start work without one. If you have permission to work in the UK, you will need to telephone the National Insurance number application line. After you’ve applied, you’ll get a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) asking you to come to a National Insurance number interview at Jobcentre Plus. The letter will also tell you which documents to bring to proof your identity.
                </p>
                <p class="getting3">
                    You can find out more information about how to apply for a National Insurance number at https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number. You may be required to attend an interview. The DWP will advise you of the appropriate application process and tell you which documents you will need to bring to an interview if one is necessary. You will usually need documents that prove your identity and that you have permission to work in the UK. A National Insurance number does not on its own prove to an employer that you have the right to work in the UK.

                <p class="driving">
                    In the UK, you must be at least 17 years old to drive a car or motorcycle and you must have a driving licence to drive on public roads. To get a UK driving licence you must pass a driving test, which tests both your knowledge and your practical skills. You need to be at least 16 years old to ride a moped, and there are other age requirements and special tests for driving large vehicles.
                </p>
                <p class="driving2">
                    Drivers can use their driving licence until they are 70 years old. After that, the licence is valid for three years at a time.
                </p>
                <p class="driving3">
                    In Northern Ireland, a newly qualified driver must display an ‘R’ plate (for restricted driver) for one year after passing the test.
                </p>
                <p class="driving4">
                    If you have a licence from another country, you may use it in the UK for up to 12 months. To continue driving after that, you must get a UK full driving licence. To check that you can drive in the UK with a non-GB licence, visit www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence.
                </p>
                <p class="driving5">
                    If you are resident in the UK, your car or motorcycle must be registered at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You must pay an annual vehicle tax, which cannot be passed on when a vehicle changes hands. If the vehicle is parked off the road and not being use, you must tell DVLA by making a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN). SORN cannot be transferred if the vehicle is sold or given to a new owner. You must also have valid motor insurance. It is a serious criminal offence to drive without insurance. If your vehicle is over three years old, you must take it to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) test every year. It is an offence not to have a MOT certificate if your vehicle is more than three years old. You can find out more about vehicle tax and MOT requirements from www.gov.uk.

                    Political parties are particularly busy at election times. Members work hard to persuade people to vote for their candidates – for instance, by handing out leaflets in the street or by knocking on people’s doors and asking for their support. This is called ‘canvassing’. You don’t have to tell a canvasser how you intend to vote if you don’t want to.

                    British citizens can stand for office as a local councillor or a member of Parliament (or the devolved equivalents). This is an opportunity to become even more involved in the political life of the UK. You may also be able to stand for office if you are an Irish citizen or an eligible Commonwealth citizen.

                <p class="helping">
                    There are opportunities to volunteer with a wide range of local service providers, including local hospitals and youth projects. Services often want to involve local people in decisions about the way in which they work. Universities, housing associations, museums and arts councils may advertise for people to serve as volunteers in their governing bodies.

                    You can volunteer with the police, and become a special constable or a lay (non-police) representative. You can also apply to become a magistrate. You will often find advertisements for vacancies in your local newspaper or on local radio. You can also find out more about these sorts of roles at www.gov.uk.

                <p class="other">
                    Volunteering is working for good causes without payment. There are many benefits to volunteering, such as meeting new people and helping make your community a better place. Some volunteer activities will give you a chance to practise your English or develop work skills that will help you find or improve your curriculum vitae (CV). Many people volunteer simply because they want to help other people.
                </p>
                <p class="other2">
                    Activities you can do as a volunteer include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>working with animals – for example, caring for animals at a local rescue shelter</li>
                    <li>youth work – for example, volunteering at a youth group</li>
                    <li>helping improve the environment – for example, participating in a litter pick-up in the local area</li>
                    <li>working with the homeless in, for example, a homelessness shelter</li>
                    <li> mentoring – for example, supporting someone who has just come out of prison</li>
                    <li>work in health and hospitals – for example, working on an information desk in a hospital</li>
                    <li>helping older people at, for example, a residential care home.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="other3">
                    There are thousands of active charities and voluntary organisations in the UK. They work to improve the lives of people, animals and the environment in many different ways. They range from British branches of international organisations, such as the British Red Cross, to small local charities working in particular areas. They include charities working with older people (such as Age UK), with children (for example, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)), and with the homeless (for example, Crisis and Shelter). There are also medical research charities (for example, Cancer Research UK), environmental charities (including the National Trust and Friends of the Earth) and charities working with animals (such as the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA)).
                </p>
                <p class="other4">
                    Volunteers are needed to help with their activities and to raise money. The charities often advertise in local newspapers, and most have websites that include information about their opportunities. You can also get information about volunteering for different organisations from www.doit.life/volunteer.

                    There are many opportunities for younger people to volunteer and receive accreditation which will help them to develop their skills. These include the National Citizen Service programme, which gives 16- and 17-year-olds the opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities, develop their skills and take part in a community project. You can find out more about these opportunities as follows:

                <b>Looking after the environment</b>
                <p class="other6">
                    It is important to recycle as much of your waste as you can. Using recycled materials to make new products uses less energy and means that we do not need to extract more raw materials from the earth. It also means that less rubbish is created, so the amount being put into landfill is reduced.
                </p>
                <p class="other7">
                    You can learn more about recycling and it benefits at www.recyclenow.com. At this website you can also find out what you can recycle at home and in the local area you live in England. This information is available for Wales at www.wasteawarenesswales.org.uk, for Scotland at zerowastescotland.org.uk and for Northern Ireland from your local authority.
                </p>
                <p class="other8">
                    A good way to support your local community is to shop for products locally where you can. This will help businesses and farmers in your area in Britain. It will also reduce your carbon footprint, because the products you buy will not have had to travel as far.
                </p>
                <p class="other9">
                    Walking and using public transport to get around when you can is also a good way to protect the environment. It means that you create less pollution that when you use a car.
